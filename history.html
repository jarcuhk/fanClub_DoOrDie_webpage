	var t1 = "2005-2006: Formation and Early Days<p>The foundation for One Ok Rock began when Toru Yamashita, then a high school student, wanted to start a band. He told his friend Ryota Kohama, a fellow member of the hip hop dance group Heads, to learn the bass and asked Alex Onizawa, who was their senior in school to join. He asked his classmate Tou to play drums, who then left the band in 2006 to pursue an acting career. At that time, Taka Moriuchi was playing with another band named Chivalry of Music; however, Taka didn't enjoy playing with them, so Toru insisted that he join One Ok Rock instead. After signing with a label, Amuse, Inc. You left the band because his parents didn't want their son to pursue that line of work. Tomoya Kanki had been teaching at ESP (Musical Academy) and was already in a band that wasn't going well. He then joined One Ok Rock in 2006, but only became an official member when they debuted in 2007.<p>The band\'s name, One Ok Rock, comes from \"one o'clock\", the time that the band used to practice on weekends. They chose to play at one o\'clock in the morning because it was cheaper to use the rehearsal space during such hours. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction between r\'s and l\'s, they changed \"o\'clock\" to \"o\'crock\" (or \"o\'krock\"), which was then separated to become \"ok rock\".";
	
	var t2 = "2007-2009: Debut Album and Old Formation<p>Their debut single, Naihishinsho, reached number 48 on the Oricon Charts and sold 15,000 copies.<p>Their second single, Yume Yume, followed that success and charted at number 43. After those singles, they released their debut album Zeitakubyō in 2007 and had their first tour, the Tokyo-Osaka-Nagoya Quattro Tour. They released their second album Beam of Light in May 2008. In an interview with Rockin\'On Japan magazine in June 2012, ONE OK ROCK said they didn\'t count this album as an album, but rather as a part of growing up as a band. When they made the album, they hadn\'t been in the right mood, but felt that they had to make it to grow as a band. The band came up with many sound sources and ended up making a punk album. The album\'s confused origins were the reason why they wouldn\'t play any songs from Beam of Light in live performances until now. Shortly after releasing Beam of Light, they performed a gig at Shibuya AX.<p>They had planned to release two albums in that one year, so they released Kanjou Effects in November 2008. At this point, the band had gained more experience and were able to do some more serious recording. They settled into the western sound they loved and followed by replacing all their engineers and introducing their music to new producers. This led to some division within the band - Taka and Alex in particular disagreed about how to make this album.<p>On April 5, 2009, Alex was arrested for groping the leg of a twenty-one-year-old female student on a train. He admitted to the charges and the case was settled out of court. The band reached their weakest point at this time. Ryota intended to leave bass and take up guitar. They felt it was impossible for them to add a new member. The band\'s next single \"Around the World Shounen\", which was planned for a May 6 release and to be used as the theme song for the TV drama God Hand Teru, and their nationwide tour were both cancelled. In May 2009, it was announced that One Ok Rock would continue on without Alex, who went back to the United States. Toru took his place as lead guitar, and the band re-arranged their songs to be played for one guitar.";
